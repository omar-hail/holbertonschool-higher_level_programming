# Python - Classes and Objects (Square)

This directory contains several implementations of a `Square` class, each task adding new features such as validation, properties, methods, and formatted printing.

---

## Files Description

- **0-square.py**  
  Basic empty `Square` class.

- **1-square.py**  
  Square with a private `size` attribute.

- **2-square.py**  
  Square with validated `size` (must be an integer ≥ 0).

- **3-square.py**  
  Square with an `area()` method that returns `size * size`.

- **4-square.py**  
  Square with `@property` and setter for size validation.

- **5-square.py**  
  Square with `my_print()` to print the square using `#`.

- **6-square.py**  
  Square with `position` attribute, validated and used to offset printing.

## Features Added Across Tasks

- Private attributes (`__size`, `__position`)
- Input validation with specific error messages
- Properties and setters for clean attribute access
- Area computation
- Visual printing of the square using `#`
- Position-based shifting of printed output

## How to Run

```bash
python3 file_name.py
```

Each file demonstrates its corresponding behavior when used inside another script.
